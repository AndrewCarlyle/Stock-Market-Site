# Stock-Market-Site
This is a project that I have taken up using some of my free time. It is a web that allows users to get stock market information a create simulated accounts.

The frontend uses JS, HTML, and CSS. The backend uses JS for the server, a SQL database to keep track of stocks and accounts, and then a Mongo database to keep track of sessions.
