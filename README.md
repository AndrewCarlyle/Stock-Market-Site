# Stock-Market-Site
This is a project that I have taken up using some of my free time. It is a web that allows users to get stock market information a create simulated accounts.

The frontend uses JS, HTML, and CSS. The backend uses JS for the server, a SQL database to keep track of stocks and accounts, and then a Mongo database to keep track of sessions.

TODO list:
1. Add some kind of ranking system for stocks
2. Organize resources better (some things are not accessible to pug files in/views)
3. Add in a way to search stocks by a certain metric(s)
4. Spend some time looking into what happens with TSX stocks
5. Fix updateStock function to account for exchange
6. Add in dividends
